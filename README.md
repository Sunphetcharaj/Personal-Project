# Welcome to "Connect 4 Cats vs Dogs Edition"
Welcome to my Project called "Connect 4 Cats vs Dogs Edition"
This project is based around the game "Connect4" 
This is a 2 player PvP board game

## How to play
There is 7 columns and 6 rows on the board
Player 1 is team Cats and Player 2 is team Dogs
You can place a Cat or Dog in any of the columns and they will fall into the lowest row available for that column
Player 1 gets the first move
The 2 players take turns placing cats and dogs until one of them connects 4 of their pieces in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally
If one of the players connects 4 of their pieces in a row then the game ends and the player who won will be shown on screen
If none of the players can connect 4 of their pieces and the entire board is filled then it will end in a draw/tie
